Tree_Fort_Defense_Revamp
========================

A sling-shot defense game in Unity
The current build only works on mobile devices. I used Unity's Player app
to push and test this build on my android device.

What we currently have:
Basic level layout optimized into 1 or 2 draw calls.
Touch to scroll
Pinch to zoom


What we need to add:

Constraining the camera to view only the game field (so it can't scroll off the page forever.)
This needs to take the current camera zoom level into account and adjust accordingly.

Draggable and shootable ammo.

Our first bad guy!
